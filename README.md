# GlobalDiaryApplication

- Description: A diary application that allows users to enter diary entries along with images to express how they are feeling at a particular moment.
- The objective of this application is to create a seamless transition between what we know as a traditional diary and an up-to-date application.
-  We want the application to be user-friendly to ensure the user is comfortable creating diary entries. We also want to make the application
- customizable to allow the user to put their own spin on what they want their diary application to look like.

***Important to note that users must be connected the firebase to ensure they can retrieve and upload to the firebase***

2. ENTRIES
- When the user logins to the app, they are presented with the entry overview, which will show all previous entries the user has made. 
- The UI design also allows the user to select which section they would like to enter next; these sections include settings, calendar, and create entry. We recommend  the user begins with the create entry section.

3. CREATE ENTRY
- This page allows the user to upload their diary entries. The user is given a selection of options on this page, which include the following: enter text, add an image,Add mood and audio. Enter text allows the user to enter some text to describe their daily experiences. 
- Add Image allows the user to add an image to their diary entries to show activities or moments that just can't be described in words. Adding mood allows users to reflect on how that day made them feel and makes looking back on entries quite easy as they know which entries had been good and which had been bad.
- Finally, to add audio functionality, we were, unfortunately, unable to fully add this functionality within the given time frame.
- That being said, this part was for the days when the user doesn't feel like writing in the entries and would like to simply express their daily experiences in words.

4. CALENDAR
- Unfortunately, we didn't have time to implement the functionality on this page either, but this page was intended as a way for users to search diary entries based on the date they were uploaded
