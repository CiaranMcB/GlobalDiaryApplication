# GlobalDiaryApplication

- Description: A diary application that allows users to enter diary entries along with images to express how they are feeling at a particular moment.
- The objective of this application is to create a seamless transition between what we know as a traditional diary and an up-to-date application.
-  We want the application to be user-friendly to ensure the user is comfortable creating diary entries. We also want to make the application
- customizable to allow the user to put their own spin on what they want their diary application to look like.

# User Manual/Steps

2. ENTRIES

3. CREATE ENTRY
- This page allows the user to upload their diary entries. The user is given a selection of options on this page, which include the following: enter text, add an
- image,
- Add mood and audio. Enter text allows the user to enter some text to describe their daily experiences. Add Image allows the user to add an image to their diary
- entries to show activities or moments that just can't be described in words. Adding mood allows users to reflect on how that day made them feel and makes
- looking back on entries quite easy as they know which entries had been good and which had been bad. Finally, to add audio functionality, we were, unfortunately,
- unable to fully add this functionality within the given time frame. That being said, this part was for the days when the user doesn't feel like writing in the
- entries and would like to simply express their daily experiences in words.

- on
- the date they were uploaded
